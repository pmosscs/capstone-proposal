1. THE PROJECT
    A real estate investment calculator. 
        "sick of paying $300 a year for a calculator? Tired of trying to figure out how to use excell? THEN DO I HAVE A CALCULATOR FOR YOU"

2. THE FEATURES 
    A user types in the numbers on a real estate deal they are looking to invest in (long term rental only). When submitted, they are given calculations of those numbers to see if the investment is good: return on initial investment, monthly cash flow, cap rate, vacancy/repair savings after certain amount of time, etc. 
    The info is then saved in "your deals" where they can see all the houses they ran numbers on, and also delete those deals. 

3. THE WIREFRAMS
